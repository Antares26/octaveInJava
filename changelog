JavaOctave (0.6.1)  2010-03-10

  * Create some skeleton objects that can get and put sparse booleans and
    ranges.
  * Create some utility functions that makes it easy to pull data out of
    octave.
  * Fix some bugs in the save format, a lot of linefeeds were placed in
    the wrong way.

JavaOctave (0.5.1) 2010-01-08

  * Handle extra line feed from exit() in octave3.2
  * Make data i OctaveComplex more accessible
  * Create OctaveFunctionHandle
  * Test under octave3.0 and octave3.2

JavaOctave (0.5.0) 2009-11-22

  * Create OctaveComplex as wrapper type for complex matrices.
  * Create an auto cast functionality in JavaOctave that is similar to one in
    C++.  It is used to transform OctaveDouble to OctaveComplex when that is
    needed.
  * Make OctaveEngine.get(), OctaveCell.get() and OctaveStruct.get() take Class
    objects as input and use the autocast to transform the type if that is
    needed.
  * Group the exceptions thrown by JavaOctave into the ones that will break the
    octave process, and the ones that will not. Make the data reading more
    robust such that getting data of an unknown type will throw an exception
    that will not break the process.
  * Delete OctaveScalar, use 1x1 OctaveMatrix and create then using the factory
    function Octave.scalar().
  * Rename OctaveType to OctaveObject.
  * Rename OctaveMatrix to OctaveDouble.
  * Document how OctaveObject.shallowCopy is used.

JavaOctave (0.4.0) 2009-10-08

  * OctaveNdMatrix is renamed to OctaveMatrix
  * OctaveScalar now behaves more like OctaveMatrix
  * OctaveBoolean added to reflect the logical type in Octave
  * Better build system and unit tests split from the main project
  * Unit test coverage added, we are using Cobertura
  * Switched from git to Mercurial
  * Examples from Wiki is tested in unit tests
  * The many fragmented OctaveMatrix tests collected into a single test of the
    type and an other test of io.
