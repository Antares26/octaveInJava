/**
 * Representations of matrices: 
 * {@link AbstractGenericMatrix} is the abstract base class of all of them. 
 * {@link BooleanMatrix} represents matrices with boolean entries, 
 * {@link DoubleMatrix} represents matrices with double entries, 
 * {@link IntMatrix} represents matrices with int entries. 
 * Besides these primitive types, 
 * {@link GenericMatrix} provides matrices with object type.
