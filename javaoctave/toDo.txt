Tests: 
- dk.ange.octave.examples.HomeExampleTest.test()
java.io.IOException: Stream closed
- dk.ange.octave.examples.HomeExampleTest.testWithFunctionInVariable()
seems not to terminate: thus deactivated using annotation @Ignore 

Tests:
in classes TestOctaveBoolean and TestOctaveDouble: 
- re-add distinction: if (matrix instanceof HasBeenInstrumented) 

Add: 
     for dk.ange.octave.io.impl.Uint8MatrixReader define corresponding 
         dk.ange.octave.io.impl.Uint8MatrixWriter 
     and add tests. 

Site: 
link to "relevant jar files" still needs authentication. 
This is not what we want. 
Maybe talk with contabo, the provider or maybe move on 
directly to maven central repository. 

Site: 
in the long run, write a maven plugin 
or look whether one exists which checks links in an application. 

User interface: 
I feel OctaveEngineFactory.setArgsArray should be deprecated 
and replaced by setOptionArray 


site: 
try out all code examples. 

api-docs: 
extend package exec and types 
the latter in conjunction with the documentation site.
